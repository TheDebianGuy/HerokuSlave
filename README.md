Abusing Heroku free plan too? Check out this...
## Introduction
Heroku is a service that allows users to host their applications for free (there are paid plans too) and supports many buildpacks and programming languages, so it can be more uselful than any free vps without root acess.
Because of that I have built a simple and lightweight app letting you to
control your heroku server via discord.
## Updates
If I get time to, Im going to make a web interface using websockets and/or
email management feature.
